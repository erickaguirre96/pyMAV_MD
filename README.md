# pyMAV_MD
## Software for MUSE Analysis Via MaNGA-DAP (MAV_MD). 

### MAV_MD provides users to utilize the broad power of the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) and apply it to MUSE data cubes.

MAV_MD gives users the important abilities to:

1. Run a raw MUSE cube through the MaNGA DAP.
2. Specifiy spatial binning and spectral templates to use for the DAP.
3. Extract flux, inverse variance and best-fit models to the data.
4. Obtain stellar kinematics and ion-emission line maps outputted by the DAP.
